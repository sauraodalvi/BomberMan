## 🎮 What is this?
I built this game to explore web-based multiplayer and game development with **Phaser 3**. It's a tribute to the classic "place bomb, run away" genre, but with modern twists like physics-based debris, dynamic lighting, and a rage-inducing "Unfair" difficulty.

It's completely free, open-source, and runs directly in your browser.
